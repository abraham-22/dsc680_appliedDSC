#### Projects Included
Project 1: Comparing Clustering Algorithms for Customer Segmentation – 
* This project aims to compare different clustering algorithms for customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior using RFM analysis. By evaluating various clustering techniques, I believe we can determine which method provides the most meaningful customer groups for business decision-making.
